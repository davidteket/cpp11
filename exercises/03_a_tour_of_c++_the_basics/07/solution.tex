 \section*{Invariant}
 
 An invariant is a \textsl{predicate} which evaluates to \texttt{true} independently (no matter) of which instruction
 is being executed as part of a \textsl{P} program's phase. 
 \\
 For instance, a loop invariant $P(I)$ will always be true 
 at the beginning and at the end in the loop's execution timeline.
 $$\Rightarrow i_1^{\{(P(I) \rightarrow true \}} , ..., i_n^{\{(P(I) \rightarrow true \}}$$
 where $i_j$ is the $j$th iteration of the loop.
 \\
 \\
 Invariants are used to determine \textsl{program correctness}.
