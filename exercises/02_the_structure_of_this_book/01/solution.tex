\section*{Meaning of (∗2.5) for an exercise}
 (∗2.5) means that providing a solution for an exercise with such a difficulty level might take up to half of the day.
 Based on the information that can be found in the attached 4thExercises.pdf:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item (∗1) might take 10 minutes to complete.
  \item (∗2) might take 1 hour to complete.
  \item (∗3) might take a day to complete.
 \end{itemize}

 However, an exercise with the difficulty of (∗5) could be done in $1.5$ hour depending on experience.
 So these numbers measuring difficulty only rough approximations and can differ from person to person.
