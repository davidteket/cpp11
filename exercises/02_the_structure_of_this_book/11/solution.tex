 \section*{5  suggestions that most likely help my programming style from \S1.3}
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item Focusing on mastering the Concepts (eg.: Type Safety, Resource Management etc.) and Techniques (eg.: using Iterators on STL Containers, using Scoped Objects)
  is a critical - knowing every details of the language is not.
  Features gather interest in context of techniques used.
  \item Learning the STL is required in order to master C++.
  \item Keep simple things simple. Represent independent ideas independently, don't overabstract and identify relationships between ideas.
  Represent ideas directly in code.
  \item Use constructors for estabilishing class invariants and destructors to revoke the execution environments of those classes.
  $\Rightarrow$ Use Constructor-Destructor pairs to simplify resource management (RAII).
  \item Use Containers (rather than arrays) and Algorithms (rather than ad-hoc code).
  Use Libraries and don't reinvent the wheel when it comes to developing real-world software.
