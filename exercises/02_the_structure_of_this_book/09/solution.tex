 \section*{Three advantages from having a library as part of the Standard}
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item Provides building blocks and solutions for common problems in forms of interfaces, types, algorithms and templates.
  \item It helps to build applications on top of it and ensures portability. A standard library will be more well known accross the community.
  \item Highly performant and ready for industrial use. Widely tested and used by a large number of users. It is generally trusted and recognizeable.
  It is considered as the origin when learning how to master techniques and concepts, thus build libraries with that language.
 \end{enumerate}
