[7] (∗2.5) Write a program that strips comments out of a C++ program. That is, read from cin,
remove both // comments and /∗ ∗/ comments, and write the result to cout. Do not worry
about making the layout of the output look nice (that would be another, and much harder,
exercise). Do not worry about incorrect programs. Beware of //, /∗, and ∗/ in comments,
strings, and character constants.
