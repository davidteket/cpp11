[1] (∗1) Rewrite the following for-statement as an equivalent while-statement:

    for (i=0; i!=max_length; i++)
    if (input_line[i] == '?')
    quest_count++;

Rewrite it to use a pointer as the controlled variable, that is, so that the test is of the form
∗p=='?'. Rewrite it to use a range-for.
