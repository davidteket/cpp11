[7] (∗2) Implement and test these functions: strlen(), which returns the length of a C-style string;
strcpy(), which copies a C-style string into another; and strcmp(), which compares two C-style
strings. Consider what the argument types and return types ought to be. Then compare your
functions with the standard library versions as declared in <cstring> (<string.h>) and as specified in §43.4
