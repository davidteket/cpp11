[5] (âˆ—2) Implement an enum called Season with enumerators spring, summer, autumn, and winter.
Define operators ++ and âˆ’âˆ’ for Season. Define input (>>) and output (<<) operations for Season, providing string values. Provide a way to control the mapping between Season values
and their string representations. For example, I might want the strings to reflect the Danish
names for the seasons. For further study, see Chapter 39.
